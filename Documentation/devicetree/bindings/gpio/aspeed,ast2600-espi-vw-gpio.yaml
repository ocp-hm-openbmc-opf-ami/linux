title: Aspeed ESPI VW GPIO controller

maintainers:
  - Nidhin M S <nidhin.ms@intel.com>

description:
  The ASPEED eSPI Slave Interface shall support the eSPI Virtual Wire
  channel and implement support for the General Purpose I/O Expander
  Virtual Wire group (Index 128..255) which allows the master to
  control GPIOs on the slave. The aim of this driver is to
  expose virtual wire gpios to be used as regular gpios using libgpiod.
  This module will work as a child of espi.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: aspeed,ast2600-espi-vw-gpio

    description: Number of VW GPIO lines. This include unnamed GPIO lines also.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 32
  gpio-names:
    description:
      Array of human readable names to be used for each GPIO. Length can be less
      than or equal to gpio-count property. Refer gpio-names-mask for usage.

  gpio-names-mask:
    description:
      Used to identify which gpio name maps to which index. For example if
      we have 32 GPIO lines and gpio-names has only 6 then this mask will be
      used to identify the 6 GPIOs which has names and all other GPIO lines
      will be marked as unused

    minimum: 0x000000

  gpio-dir-mask:
    description:
      Bitmask used to identify which GPIO is input and which is output.
      1 denotes output and 0 means input GPIO.
