* Aspeed LPC SIO driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of:
	"aspeed,ast2400-lpc-sio"
	"aspeed,ast2500-lpc-sio"
- reg : Should contain lpc-sio registers location and length
- clocks: contains a phandle to the syscon node describing the clocks.
	  There should then be one cell representing the clock to use.

Example:
lpc_sio: lpc-sio@100 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-lpc-sio";
	reg = <0x100 0x20>;
        clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_LCLK>;
	status = "disabled";
};
