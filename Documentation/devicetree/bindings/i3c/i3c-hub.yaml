description: |
  I3C HUB is smart device which provides multiple functionality:
  * enabling voltage compatibility across I3C Controller and Target devices,
  * bus capacitance isolation
  * address conflict isolation
  * I3C port expansion
  * two controllers in a single I3C bus
  * I3C and SMBus device compatibility
  * GPIO expansion

  Having such big number of features, there is a need to have some DT knobs to tell the I3C HUB
  driver which features shall be enabled and how they shall be configured. I3C HUB driver read,
  validate DT knobs and set corresponding registers with the right way to satisfy user requests from
  DT.

  All the DT properties for I3C HUB are located under dedicated (for I3C HUB) DT entry. I3C HUB DT
  entry structure is aligned with regular I3C device DT entry described in i3c.yaml.

      I3C HUB ID based on CSEL pin. There are three possible values:
      0 - CP0 is selected as primary Controller Port
      1 - Primary Controller Port is selected by software by writing the REG#56
      3 - CP1 is selected as primary Controller Port

      I3C HUB driver reads CSEL pin status (REG#121[5:4]) and tries to find DT node with matching
      value in 'id' property.

      This property is optional. If not provided, DT node can only be used by the I3C HUB driver if
      there is no others with matching 'id' or 'id-cp1'. If there are multiple DT nodes with no
      'id' property - the first one will be chosen by I3C HUB driver. If there are multiple DT
      nodes with matching 'id' property - the first one will be chosen by I3C HUB driver.

      If both 'id' and 'id-cp1' are available, DT node will be chosen only when both values match
      those read from I3C HUB.

    enum:
      - 0

      I3C HUB ID based on CP1 SDA and SCL pins state probed during power on.

      I3C HUB driver reads CP1 SDA and SCL pin status and tries to find DT node with matching value
      in 'id-cp1' property.

      This property is optional. If not provided, DT node can only be used by the I3C HUB
      driver if there is no others with matching 'id' or 'id-cp1'. If there are multiple DT nodes

      multiple DT nodes with matching 'id-cp1' property - the first one will be chosen by I3C HUB
      driver.

      If both 'id' and 'id-cp1' are available, DT node will be chosen only when both values match
      those read from I3C HUB.
